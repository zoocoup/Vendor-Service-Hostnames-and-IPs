# Vendor Service Hostnames, Domains and IPs

Collection of hostnames, domains and IPs collected from various vendors' documentation and additional addresses observed during network monitoring on endpoints. These addresses can be used to create network allowlists. 

Please note these lists are meant to be comprehensive but might not be complete, especially as time passes. Also, they are US-centric, so be sure to check for additional service domains if outside of the United States.
