# Vendor Service Hostnames, Domains and IPs

Collection of hostnames, domains, IP addresses and URLs collected from various vendors' documentation and from monitoring network traffic on client/desktop endpoints. These lists were compiled for use in CASB and firewall allowlists.

Please note the intent was to be comprehensive but likely these are not 100% complete, especially as time passes. Additionally, these lists are US-centric, so be sure to check for additional service domains if outside of the United States.
