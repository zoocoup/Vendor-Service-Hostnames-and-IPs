# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/gitlab_com/#ip-range

```
GitLab.com uses the IP ranges 34.74.90.64/28 and 34.74.226.0/24 for traffic from its Web/API fleet. This whole range is solely allocated to GitLab. You can expect connections from webhooks or repository mirroring to come from those IPs and allow them.
GitLab.com is fronted by Cloudflare. For incoming connections to GitLab.com, you might need to allow CIDR blocks of Cloudflare (IPv4 and IPv6).

For outgoing connections from CI/CD runners, we are not providing static IP addresses. All GitLab.com shared runners are deployed into Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Any IP-based firewall can be configured by looking up all IP address ranges or CIDR blocks for GCP.
